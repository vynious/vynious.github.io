Hi, I'm **Shawn Thiah** — a software engineer interested in **low-level programming, optimization, and building high-performance systems**.  

Outside of code, I'm passionate about **photography, travel, and tinkering** with new tools — I like exploring ideas the same way I explore cities: by wandering, experimenting, and connecting the dots.
